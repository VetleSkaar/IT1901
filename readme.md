Welcome to our IT1901 Fall 2021 course application.

With this application we aim to build a casino, where users can gamble using currency.

[Insert App picture here]

Userstories;
-As a customer, I want to be able to gamble so that I can become rich.
-As an owner, I want my customers to lose money so that I can become rich.
-As an owner, I want to test my application to avoid upset customers.
-As a user, I want the application to be viewable and not just in the terminal.

From lectures, remove later.
''User stories

    short, simple descriptions for application features

    formulated from the stand point of the user / customer

    template:

        As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.

    they are not replacing design documents / requirements specification

    they need to be developed into specific tasks and connected to constraints and other meaningful documentation.''
